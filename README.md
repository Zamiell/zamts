# zamts

`zamts` is a command-line tool that will bootstrap a new TypeScript project. (It's short for "Zamiel TypeScript".)

<br>

## Why?

Setting up new TypeScript projects is a pain. You have to do `npm init --yes`, install deps, make a `tsconfig.json` file, set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), set up [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings, set up [git](https://git-scm.com/), set up [cspell](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell) settings, and more. It's very annoying.

Instead, simply use this bootstrapper. Tell it the name of your project, and it will create a new directory with everything already set up for you.

## How?

Use it like so:

```
npx zamts init my-project
```
